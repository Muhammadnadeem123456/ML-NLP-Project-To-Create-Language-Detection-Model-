# ML-NLP-Project-To-Create-Language-Detection-Model-

#**Language Detection using Naive Bayes**

#**Overview**

  This project implements a language detection model using machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The model identifies the language of a given text by       
  leveraging the Bag-of-Words representation and the Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier.

**1-Features**
  -Detects the language of text input from multiple supported languages.

  -Achieves a high accuracy of 95.31% using a simple Bag-of-Words model.
  
  -Includes preprocessing, vectorization, and model training steps.

**2-Dataset**
  -The dataset used contains text samples in various languages, with 1000 samples per language. The dataset is balanced and consists of the following languages:

  -Estonian, Swedish, Thai, Tamil, Dutch, Japanese, Turkish, Latin, Urdu, Indonesian, Portuguese, French, Chinese, Korean, Hindi, Spanish, Pushto, Persian, Romanian, Russian, English,     
     Arabic.

**3-Technologies Used**
  -Python: Programming language for implementing the project.
  
  -Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
  
  -NumPy: For numerical computations.
  
  -Scikit-learn: For machine learning tasks, including feature extraction and modeling.
  
**4-How It Works**

  **-Data Preprocessing:**

      Text is converted into a numerical format using the CountVectorizer (Bag-of-Words model).

      Each text is represented as a sparse matrix of token counts.
      
  **-Model Training:**

      The Multinomial Naive Bayes algorithm is trained on the tokenized text data.
      
 ** -Model Evaluation:**
 
     The model is evaluated on a test set, achieving an accuracy of 95.31%.

  ** -Prediction:**

      The trained model predicts the language of new text samples.
